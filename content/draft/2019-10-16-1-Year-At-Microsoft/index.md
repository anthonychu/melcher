In this post I will try to summarize the past year at Microsoft - my very first - and share some highlights with you. <!--more-->

## Cloud Solution Architect

In October 2018, I was fortunately enough to join Microsoft, and after only 3 weeks of hiring process - landed in a dream job in a dream team. The role that sounded like lots of marketing and pre-sales, is actually very very technical. Even with tons of Azure knowledge and background, I am learning new stuff daily. And I thought I knew Microsoft!

Now, one year in the role, I help customers on their Azure cloud journey:

* finding the right architecture to solve business and technical problems
* bridging the gap between customer and product development groups,  
prioritizing the right things and making things right
* evangelizing Azure
* sharing best practices and new technologies
* helping onboard new customers and colleagues

## Customer
## Always Learning
### Infrastructure
### Azure Certification
### Learning, things other than Azure
### OpenHack
### Internal Training

## Team - standing on the shoulders of giants
## Customer Centricity / Tech Intensity
## Community
