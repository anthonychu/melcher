In this post I will try to summarize the past year at Microsoft - my very first - and share some highlights with you. <!--more-->

## Cloud Solution Architect

In October 2018, I was fortunately enough to join Microsoft, and after only 3 weeks of hiring process - landed in a dream job in a dream team with a dream manager. The role that initially sounded like lots of marketing and pre-sales, is actually very very technical. Even with tons of Azure knowledge and large-scale project experience, I am learning new stuff daily. Combined with the Microsoft organizational complexity - it's fun!  
And I thought, as ex-MVP, I knew Microsoft!

Now, one year in the role, I help customers on their Azure cloud journey:

* finding the right architecture to solve business and technical problems
* bridging the gap between customer and product development groups,  
prioritizing the right things and making things right
* evangelizing Azure
* help with proof of concepts
* architecture and whiteboarding
* sharing best practices and new technologies
* helping onboard new customers and colleagues
* removing blockers

And, very important, we do not:

* handle support cases
* write code that goes in production and is supported for 10 years and all that
* cover every product that Microsoft has to offer
* replace your team and/or partner - you need them for production deployments

We now have more than 100 architects working in our organization, each and every person bringing their own unique background and perspective. I enjoy this diversity of skills and ideas and love the every day exchange. I doubt youâ€™ll be able to find such a highly motivated team of experts anywhere else in Germany!
