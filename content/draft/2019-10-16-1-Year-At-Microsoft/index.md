In this post, I will try to summarize the past year and very first year at Microsoft as Cloud Solution Architect in the Customer Success Unit and share some of the highlights with you. <!--more-->

## Cloud Solution Architect

In October 2018, I was fortunate enough to join Microsoft, and after only 3 weeks of hiring - landed in a dream job, Cloud Solution Architect, in a dream team with a dream manager. The role that initially sounded like lots of marketing and pre-sales, is very very technical. Even with tons of Azure knowledge and large-scale project experience, I am learning new stuff daily. Combined with the Microsoft organizational complexity - it's fun!  
And I *thought*, as ex-MVP, I knew Microsoft!

Now, one year in the role, I help customers on their Azure cloud journey:

* finding the right architecture to solve business and technical problems
* bridging the gap between customer and product development groups,  
prioritizing the right things and making things right
* evangelizing Azure
* help with proof of concepts
* architecture and whiteboarding
* sharing best practices and new technologies
* helping onboard new customers and colleagues
* removing blockers

And, very important, we do not:

* handle support cases
* write code that goes in production and is supported for 10 years and all that
* cover every product that Microsoft has to offer
* replace your team and/or partner - you need them for production deployments

We now have more than 100 architects working in our organization, every person bringing their unique background and perspective into the mix. I enjoy this diversity of skills and ideas and love the everyday exchange in the office. I doubt youâ€™ll find such a highly motivated team of experts anywhere else in Germany!

## Customers

Pretty much everything in the Cloud Solution Architect (CSA) role, circles around the customer - customer-centricity is the buzz we use internally for that. In other words, we are advocates for the customer, help them get heard in the development teams - and help them get the most out of Azure. 

I landed in the Financial Services and Insurance (FSI) sector and we focus on the German customers - and all of them are huge and with that have huge challenges in adopting cloud technologies. So if you think that something works great, then they throw 100.000 concurrent people at it and it will definitely tell you very clearly that there is room for improvement.

Some of the customers have zero cloud adoption, some of them have everything in the cloud - I totally like the different stages and the great flexibility we have to help the customers understanding what is required to tackle the next step in cloud maturity.

## Always Learning

  The Learn-It-All Does Better Than the Know-It-All
{{< /blockquote >}}

In the past, I have learned so much and there was not a single day were I did not learn or had to learn. In the following I share some of it:

### Infrastructure

So my customer has tons of infrastructure-related questions - and with my strong development background I could not answer some of them in-depth - and I had to learn it. 
Most of the time reading our docs was pretty helpful, but working at Microsoft gives you access to much more. Most importantly wickedly smart colleagues and a short teams message or mail helped me, and in the end, the customer to understand whats going on. 
And after like half a year I felt pretty convenient with all these networking topics, still need to look up how many IPs are in a /27 subnet. 

In July then I decided to do the [AZ-300 (Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-300) most realistic exam because it covered the architecture challenges of the past half-year. Good stuff.

### Azure Certification

But the AZ-300 and AZ-301 were not the only certifications I have done in the last year - my default go-to would have been the [AZ-203 (Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-203) and [AZ-400](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-400), and once you are into this learning thing, it did them, too. The AZ-400 was my favorite in this track, of course.

### Learning, things other than Azure

So technical skilling is super important - but Microsoft embraces a holistic approach and even the typically quite boring "standards of business conduct" (SBC) are epic. See this thread by clicking on the twitter icon in the top right for more insights about it:

### OpenHack

And one of my learning experience highlight is, again, OpenHack - I have done two OpenHacks before joining Microsoft, and two in the last year. And I cant stress it enough - if its possible for you, go attend one. They are free and fun - and if learning in a small group with a smart proctor on real-world challenges is your thing. Go sign up: https://openhack.microsoft.com/

So far I have done: 

1. DevOps
2. IoT + Data
3. DevOps (again, customer-specific)
4. Containers

The container OpenHack really really made sense and with all this hands-on experience and the smart people that I am not connected with - it makes my life easier. And I now feel really at ease answering questions about it without always bothering the container champs we have at Microsoft. Kubernetes all the things!

See this post by my colleague Mo and see the setup of the last OpenHack in Munich:

### Speaker Training

And even more learning. Just recently I signed up for an "Massively Open Online Course" (MooC) that's called "Story Impact" to improve my speaking skills - it was time intensive and in the end, I had to hand in a video recording of me presenting. But well, I feel like it helped me a lot!

## Community

When I joined Microsoft, I was worried that I cannot contribute to the community as much as I did when I was outside and MVP. But to the opposite, some tasks like getting a decent meeting room for a community event is now way way easier. 
So last year we hosted, [AzureSaturday Munich](https://AzureSaturday.de), the third time in the Microsoft Office in Munich - and supporting this as an employee was way easier.


## Closing

So with all that said, I can conclude a very successful and fun first year - and I am looking forward to the next.
