Staying "current" with the always evolving Azure platform is not an easy task. Here are some tricks and websites to make this a little bit easier:

## Azure Learning Paths & Certifications

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure/ 

The learning paths are super helpful to discover and master Azure topics - they are free but still very high quality. Once you have done some learning paths, I highly recommend getting [Azure certifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/browse/?terms=azure) - they are great in the CV and help you speak the 'Azure language'. 

## Azure Friday

Is it Friday again? Then there will be a new episode of [Azure Friday](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/azure-friday/) with Scott Hanselman and engineers who build and run services that power Azure - its both fun and very informative! Go subscribe to not miss an episode!

## Podcasts

Are you learning with your ears? Travelling a lot? Then maybe subscribe to an Azure podcast to stay current - the mentioned Azure Friday is available, too: 
https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Azure-Friday

Or 'The Azure Podcast' going back till 2013 with lots of Azure engineers sharing their expertise:

## Azure Community: Events & Social Media

A while back I would have recommended to attend local community events, user groups or Azure Saturday's - there are some, most of them are virtual: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/community/events/

Additionally, follow Azure engineers, PMs, advocates on Azure - the folks are very easy to reach there: https://twitter.com/azure 

## Azure Updates

{{< fancybox "images" "AzureUpdate.png" "Azure updates, the central place for all updates" "single_image" >}}

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/

Lastly, [Azure updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/) - the central place for all new and updated Azure things. If you want to have the latest news, features and sometimes even retirements, watch this page!
