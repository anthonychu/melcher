Today a new webcast on the [SharePoint Toolbox][1] was released. It's about the very cool [AutoSPSourcebuilder][2] powershell script.

### Summary

The webcast shows you how to create SharePoint 2013 installer package with bundled Prerequisites (so you can install SharePoint without Internet-Connection) and includes the SharePoint 2013 Cumulative Update December 2012. Language packs or even Service packs could be added, too.

Its available in [English][3] and [German][4].

### Feedback, questions or tool suggestions much appreciated.
