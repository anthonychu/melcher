Here are my notes about the SharePoint Conference 2014 Keynote “live” from Las Vegas.

## Figures

Opened by Jared Spataro.

10.000 people from 80 countries are attending this years SPC.
  
SharePoint has an incredible 500% user growth, double digit revenue growth – and growing.
  
Office 365: $1.5 billion, 60% of Fortune 500 companies are using it.

> The Cloud is on fire!

## President Bill Clinton

> When I became President there were 50 sites on the internet – in total.

Key message is that technology is changing our world – faster adoption of technology, cheaper and more reliable.

## Transforming Work

4 trends: Cloud, Social, Mobile, Big Data.

New Project with code name OSLO.

### O365

New video service hosted on O365, azure media service and yammer based on SharePoint – comes out later this year.

Julia White now shows Office Graph.

Yammer integrated into Outlook hosted on O365.

Preview of Documents on OWA is now with Yammer integration – you can now discuss documents

### Oslo

Oslo App: Information that is relevant to me comes to me. I don’t have to look for it. Was it viewed by me, liked by me? What is trending around me.

Oslo has a great custom search integration with preset search filters “presented to me”, “trending around me”, “viewed by me” and more”.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="IMG_1625" alt="IMG_1625" src="http://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1625_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="184" border="0" />][5]{.thickbox}

Oslo has a natural language search. Office Graphs shows who you are working with the most – you can see that from co-workers, too. A personal dashboard.

Office 365 Video Portal based on Azure Media Service.

### OneDrive for Business

Julia shows OneDrive for Business with native experience on an iPad – shows the app and then opened it in Safari. Great experience everywhere.

### PowerBI

Julia shows a Q&A Site with a natural language search query – she searches for “average annual income per person vs population” – then the graph updates – awesome stuff.

## Build AMAZING Solutions

1/3 of the audience are developers -

> We love Developers around SharePoint

SDK for Android published on GitHub.

No code applications are available based on Access on O365.

> Access is the simplest way to build cloud apps.

Arpin Shah, Senior Director shows a custom SharePoint list. Now he shows how to integrate this list into outlook, called composed Apps.

The app shows data sitting in SharePoint and enriches it with context data – one of the approvers was out of office and it was visualized in the app. Simple.

## Manage with Confidence

Security. Privacy. Compliance

Cloud onramp: More hybrid features.

OneDrive for Business as a standalone option. 25GB per user, Office and more.

## Summary

They covered so many topics in this keynote - I hardly can summarize this and I am sure I did not catch everything. But wow, good stuff!
