Yesterday the <a title="SharePoint 15 Technical Preview Managed Object Model Software Development Kit" href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/confirmation.aspx?id=28768" target="_blank">SharePoint 2013 SDK</a> (Preview) was released and that made me thinking:

## What are my wishes for SharePoint 2013

  1. FAST for SharePoint as Service Application
  * That's my top wish. Easier provisioning of FAST and easier (cheaper :)) licensing, e.g. coupled with ECALs, would help FS4SP to cover more ground.
  * The same applies to Reporting Services with SQL 2012 (Denali) so I think my wish could come true.

  2. jQuery Integration (no silverlight anymore! )
  * Drag and Drop everywhere
  * More ajax / WCF-Webservices

  3. Metro-Style MasterPages
  4. Better Linq for SharePoint
  * Support impersonation!

  5. Powershell everywhere
  * Configuring something in the Central Administration and the option to get the configuration changes as a powershell script - would love it! I heard somewhere that's the way Exchange does it&#8230;

&nbsp;

## **More wishes to come**

I think that's a good start, I will update the post with more wishes over time.

## How about your wishes? Share them please!
