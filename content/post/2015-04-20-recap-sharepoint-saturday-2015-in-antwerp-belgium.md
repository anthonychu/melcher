300 attendees on a Saturday - all “SharePoint-crazy”. Its my first visit to Belgium and I must say: I am impressed of the community and the spirit here. In the following I recap SharePoint Saturday 2015 in Antwerp.

## SPSBE

From the start at 9:00am until the official end of SPSBE (SharePoint Saturday Belgium) at around 17:30 I had good fun. I apparently had to prepare my session on this Saturday, tests my demos and optimize my slides - so I could only attend one full session ([see my summary here][1]), but there was enough time for me to talk to community members, board members and other speakers - good times, good fun.

Some of the attendees stayed for the BBQ after the event - it was nice to share some ideas, get feedback - and well, the food was nice, too!

I must say, for a free event organized by a community, this was perfectly done - there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nothing</span> I could rant about (and that’s almost impossible, because its free, right?). Good job [@BIWUG][2] ([Belgian Information Worker User Group][3]) - I am leaving Belgium impressed.

Thanks again to all the sponsors who made the event possible!

## Speakers & Sessions

[20 sessions and as many speakers][4] from around the world attracted 300 attendees - not only from Belgium. In general the conferenced covered all kind of different topics, but the main themes were Office 365 with topics like development, governance, adoption, best practices, workflows, search, apps and solutions. Good stuff!

## My Session: Search-Driven Applications with SharePoint 2013

I had a really good time presenting my content regarding Search-Driven Applications with SharePoint 2013 - I uploaded my slides, but the cool stuff is in the demos and I can't make them available:

After the talk there were like 10 to 15 questions - some of them I would love to show you here:

### Q: Do Query Variables work for Office 365 / SharePoint Online?

Yes, Query Variables are awesome and do work for SharePoint Online - [see a reference here.][5]

### Q: How can I recrawl SharePoint Online User Profiles?

Once you changed the mapping of the managed properties, you need to tell SharePoint Online to recrawl the profiles. There is a PowerShell for that, [see Mikael's post][6].

### Q: How to estimate and test load patterns for SharePoint search scenarios (e.g. in a publishing scenario)?

Estimation is tough, you need a lot of experience for that. And you need to know a lot upfront about the environment, the use cases, the users, &#8230; - if you don't know that, you need to scale, test and adjust. One possible solution to test load patterns upfront is to use Visual Studio Test Manager and use the REST url to query for results. Then you can increase the load and see what could break and how to optimize.

### **Q: Some Chinese documents are not index properly, at least they are not presented to certain users. Why? **

I could only guess - multi-language is a complex topic. They guys tried a lot with forced language property, but without seeing and environment, well - good luck!

### **Q: Why didn't you cover Display Templates in your session**

Display Templates are awesome. Search is awesome. Apparently I only had 1 hour so I could not cover that much without loosing somewhere else. Of course they are an important part of a search-driven application that presents results within SharePoint. If you want to read more about Display Templates, go read <a title="Elio Struyf" href="http://www.eliostruyf.com/?s=display+templates" target="_blank">Elio's blo</a>g or <a title="Mikael Svenson" href="http://techmikael.blogspot.de/search?q=display+template" target="_blank">Mikael's blog</a> - they have pretty good articles about them. Or look [at my basic example here][7].

## Summary

I totally enjoyed it - still I am a _little_ tired because my friend Andy ([@meligo][8]) insisted to tour me around Antwerp! Thanks for having me! <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" src="https://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/wlEmoticon-smile4.png" alt="Smile" />

To sum it all up: That was my first international SharePoint Saturday - and it won't be my last!

See you latest next year Belgium!
