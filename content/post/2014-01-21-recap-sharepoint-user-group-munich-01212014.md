First User Group in Munich - with [live streaming][1] to google hangout - pretty cool stuff!

## Session 1: Migrations and their pitfalls

First session by Dennis Hobmaier ([@DHobmaier][2]) about SharePoint migrations.
  
Key take-aways: templates, custom-code, permissions, workflows are the main causes of trouble - thats new 😉

## Session 2: Offerings for the SharePoint Community in Germany - or how to create a podcast

Michael Greth ([@mysharepoint][3]) showed us the various offerings for the large SharePoint Community in Germany (there are around 30 User Groups):

SharePoint Forums
  
SharePoint Special Deals
  
SharePoint Community Calendar
  
SharePoint Toolbox
  
SharePoint Podcasts (appears biweekly in German)

In the second part Michael showed us his audio equipment and how simple it is to record a podcast - impressive!
  
That session was good fun, very entertaining!

## Session 3: Sharepoint with Sql Server 2012 Always On

Last but not least a session by Mario Spies (AvePoint) about SQL high availability.

**Always On Failover Cluster**: One (idle) failover cluster with shared storage - if your storage dies, your SharePoint is very sad&#8230;
  
**Always On Availability Groups**: Basically a mirror, up to 1:4 mirroring.

Then Mario showed a live demo with failover - nice one! Learned a lot, thanks!
