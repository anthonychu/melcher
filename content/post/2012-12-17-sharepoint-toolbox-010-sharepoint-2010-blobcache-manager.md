I created another episode of the SharePoint Toolbox: SharePoint 2010 BlobCache Manager.

First time I reviewed the solution with a performance evaluation and the first time ever I contributed to a Codeplex project - interesting times!

You can watch it in [English][1] or [German][2].

## Abstract

The SharePoint 2010 BlobCache Manager enables you to control the BlobCache settings from Central Admin. You don’t have to maintain these settings on each web frontend manually. As benefit you get fewer database requests and faster page loads.

## Feedback? Suggestions?

As usual, I would love to hear your feedback - or if I should review your favorite tool, drop me a line!
