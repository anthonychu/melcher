It started with music – and then Brian started a great session. Here are my notes!

<!--more-->

> More demos or more PowerPoint presentations?

Great question to start a session – I will copy that one!

## Modern Deployment for Modern Applications

Role-back was yesterday, the new thing is role-forward! When you can deliver a feature every day, the consumer will happily install an update every day. This includes “no downtime” as a requirement.

## Demo

During the session Brian showed us how to adjust the build and publish profile with Team Foundation Server 2012.

## Special Bonus Points

Brian showed how to adjust the publishing so that a SharePoint App is deployed on Sharepoint.com.

## My evaluation

Good session –. too bad I got distracted by sooo many mails and phone calls. I will watch the session again once the video is available.
