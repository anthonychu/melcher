I mentioned Chocolatey and Powershell quite often in the last time, today I created two little helpers and uploaded them to the [chocolatey gallery][1].

The two super-awesome (and simple) packages called **SharePoint.HiveShortcut.Desktop** and **SharePoint.HiveShortCut.Explorer** - and the name indicates it, they create shortcuts to the hive folder.

I could just upload the two lines of powershell on this blog, but I totally like the Chocolatey approach - makes it easy for everyone.

## Why you need the Hive-folder?

Good question, most of the time if something is not working as expected. Ever wondered if a feature is where it should be? Images missing? Unsupported customizations? 14-/ 15- folder is the place to go.

SharePoint.HiveShortcut.Desktop: [Chocolatey Gallery][2]

SharePoint.HiveShortcut.Explorer: [Chocolatey Gallery][3]

Github [repository][4] for all my SharePoint chocolatey packages.

## Next tools for Chocolatey

On my personal roadmap are two tools which will be available on the chocolatey gallery very soon.

  * <span style="line-height: 13px;">SharePoint Manager</span>
  * Caml Designer
