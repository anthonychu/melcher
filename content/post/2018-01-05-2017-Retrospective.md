2017 was a very special year. And a super busy one. And exciting - well, almost all adjectives would fit for that CRAZY year! It was full of work, community stuff - and family time...!!!!<!--more--> 


## My first MVP Award
1st of March 2017 was a very very surprising day for me: I was in the office, it was around 17:00 and I was working on something very focused. Then I noted a new mail in my inbox:

{{< fancybox "/images" "MVP-Award-Email.png" "the single most wanted email" "single_image" >}}

The mail of all mails! At first, I thought my friend [Ben Abt](https://schwabencode.com/) sent me a fake mail to make fun of me - but once I checked the links in the mail and had to sign an NDA - I almost fell off my chair! Now, I am very proud to be an MVP and I hope that my passion and energy is enough to be an MVP for the years to come. There are so many great MVPs in this 'family' that I can look up to and learn - good stuff!

If you want to be MVP yourself, I can recommend you this [article](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/pages/what-it-takes-to-be-an-mvp)

## Events
Reflecting the entire year is almost impossible. But I track a lot in my outlook calendar so let's start with the [events](/events) that I attended - compared to the last years that weren't that many. Most notably, I attended the very excelent [SharePoint Saturday in Munich](http://www.spsevents.org/city/Munich/Munich2017/sessions) ([my review](/2017/03/my-notes-sharepoint-saturday-munich-2017-spsmuc/)) and 2017 was the first time I organized a large event myself. Maybe I should track the online events this year, I attended countless online events, too.

## Azure Saturday

It was 23rd of December 2016. Something crazy must have been in the drinking water because I skyped with [Ben Abt](https://twitter.com/abt_benjamin), [Tom Janetscheck](https://twitter.com/azureandbeyond), [Patrick Heyde](https://twitter.com/patrickheyde), [Jan Schenk](https://twitter.com/jansche) and [Dennis Gassen](https://twitter.com/trikkser) (**follow those guys on Twitter, they are awesome!**) and suggested to have an event focussed on Azure similar to the awesome SharePoint Saturday events - thats how [Azure Saturday](https://azuresaturday.de) was born. That idea was so much fun, that I spent over a month preparing and organizing everything to host an event for more than 250 people...

and there is even a youtube recording of Donovan Brown's very awesome keynote:

This was so awesome and will be repeated. I might regret it the weeks before, but once the event is running - its super fun.

## Family

March 2017 was really rewarding to me - first I got the MVP award as mentioned above - and on 6th of March my beautiful, always smiling first daughter was born. Sophia Linda makes me super super happy - and she is best thing that happened to me. Ever.

## Global Office 365 Developer Bootcamp

{{< fancybox "/images" "go365devbootcamp_dark.png" "Office 365 Developer Bootcamp" "o365dev" >}}

As you might have seen in this [post](/2017/10/3x-office-365-developer-bootcamps-munich-berlin-hamburg/) I organized 3 bootcamps in Germany - they were all different, different speakers, different crowds - but all were fun. If there is a similar global event in 2018 - I will arrange at least one in Munich. This year we focused on Microsoft Teams and Azure Bots - great stuff, I learned a lot while having fun.

## Shift of technology

In the past I was heavily focused on SharePoint (server) and SharePoint Search - in 2017 things changed a lot in Germany and for me as consultant. Maybe it's because of GDPR, the German Cloud or simply zeitgeist - people are switching to the cloud and I help them on their journey. So to my focus broadened ***a bit*** to Office 365, Azure (especially Azure Germany) and Microsoft Teams. Fun and interesting times for me!

## This blog

Recently I switch to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) (see [this post](/post/2017-11-02-ByeByeWordpress-HelloHugo/)) - and so far I really like it. It's fast and lightweight - and writing posts is fun again. For 2018 my goal is to write more than just 1 post per month - maybe I even start smaller posts with things I learned today. In 2017 I created only 11 posts, but reached **100.000 page views per year** - phew...

## Future

For 2018 I will try to speak and blog more - technology-wise there is enough coming to keep me busy and excited (looking at you, SharePoint 2019, Azure and Microsoft Teams!), thats for sure. 2018, go challenge us!
Unfortunately I have to pass my very first MVP Summit in March next year - its the very first birthday of my little one and I wont miss it. But there will be a next time (hopefully).

With that said, I wish you all the best for 2018, health, prosperity, lots of excitement and fun - see you around!
