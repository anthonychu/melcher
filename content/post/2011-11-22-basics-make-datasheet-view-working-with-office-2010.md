If you ever had problems running the datasheet view with one of the following reasons:

  * A datasheet component that is compatible with Windows SharePoint Services is not installed.
  * A Microsoft Office 2003 Professional edition is not installed on the computer.
  * The Web browser does not support ActiveX controls.
  * Support for ActiveX controls is disabled.

Try installing the old Office components:
