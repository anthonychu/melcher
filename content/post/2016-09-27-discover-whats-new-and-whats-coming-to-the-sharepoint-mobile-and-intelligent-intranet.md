Session with Mark Kashmann ([@mkashman][1]) and Adam Harnetz (<a href="https://twitter.com/AdamHarmetz" target="_blank">@adamharnetz</a>) about whats coming for SharePoint intranets especially in regards to mobile.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="WP_20160927_10_50_40_Rich" src="https://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/WP_20160927_10_50_40_Rich_thumb.jpg" alt="WP_20160927_10_50_40_Rich" width="244" height="139" border="0" />][3]

Here are my session notes:

## Customer usecase: Delta

Delta has 500 content creators; previously it was only posible to do that

80.000 employees, entire user base is 260.000 with externals.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="WP_20160927_10_57_43_Rich" src="https://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/WP_20160927_10_57_43_Rich_thumb.jpg" alt="WP_20160927_10_57_43_Rich" width="244" height="139" border="0" />][4]

Mobile is increasing

Replaced legacy technology

Delta is now starting to move to O365 SharePoint Online, but starts with OneDrive

## Mobile App

Sites Tab is powered by Office Graph depending on your usage.

Once you open a site you see the new site experience in the app, starting with News, followed by Activity:

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="WP_20160927_11_06_07_Rich" src="https://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/WP_20160927_11_06_07_Rich_thumb.jpg" alt="WP_20160927_11_06_07_Rich" width="139" height="244" border="0" />][5]

Popular & active content will be surfaced there.

Adam then showed end to end how to access SharePoint data from his iOS device, from list to user profiles.

The number one requested feature was “edit listitems”  - and thats coming to the mobile apps. The iOS is updated every second week, awesome.

“Intranet in your pocket” is the core idea of the apps – looks good.

“News” tab is brand new and not yet available:

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="WP_20160927_11_17_14_Rich" src="https://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/WP_20160927_11_17_14_Rich_thumb.jpg" alt="WP_20160927_11_17_14_Rich" width="138" height="244" border="0" />][6]

It will show you news around you, not just from one teamsite.

### PowerApps

The PowerApps will be integrated into the apps, they can be launced directly.

### Links

Links are coming document libraries, you get a flyout to add links to any url or to files you used based on Office Graph (?).

### Extensibility

Again DocuSign is shown in the new document library experience, based on the new SharePoint Framework SPFx. More to come on this.

### People Card / Profiles

Every User field now will be rendered as hover item called people card. It shows documents that the person created/recent documents and switch the full user profile (new experience!).

### Outlook Integration

You can click on “get link” in SharePoint and paste the link into Outlook Online. It will then get rendered as a small preview with a small slug, neat!

### Image Library

Images are now rendered in a lightbox, with slider controls to go to next/prev images.

### Teamsite Sync with OneDrive Next Gen Sync Client

Thats a highly anticipated feature and its coming.

### New Page Experience

The new editing experience is much better than the older – SharePoint, welcome to 2016! Its so much easier to customize a page, format text, add webparts. A big core component of SharePoint gets a major improvement. Awesome!

### PowerApps #2

Simple option to request input from others, data is persisted in a SharePoint list.

### Flow

Automate processes. Here a simple twitter integration was shown, need to look at this closer.

## Roadmap

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="https://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/image_thumb-1.png" alt="image" width="244" height="135" border="0" />][9]

Busy year for the SharePoint team, lots of stuff was already shipped. Q4 updates look promising!

> Q4 was about teamsites, 2017 will be about awesome publishing experience

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="WP_20160927_11_55_38_Rich" src="https://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/WP_20160927_11_55_38_Rich_thumb.jpg" alt="WP_20160927_11_55_38_Rich" width="244" height="139" border="0" />][10]

2017: Improvements to addins are coming, responsiveness was mentioned! PowerApps and Flow get more power.

> Teamsites works best when there is a hero in the organization

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="https://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/image_thumb-2.png" alt="image" width="244" height="143" border="0" />][11]

## Summary

Great overview whats coming – mobile or not, it looks good and sounds promising! Go watch the recording once its available, I could not catch everything in this blog post and it’s definitely worth watching!
