So [Ignite][1] is over - and I am pretty impressed how fast the content is available! I followed the first conference (we even had a [community hangout][2] during the first keynote) of this style closely via twitter - and the feedback there was quite interesting! Most importantly for me as a SharePoint guy, was of course the announcements of SharePoint 2016. And well, you can be of different opinion of the rescheduled release - but lets focus on the positive side: It’s the first time that we publicly hear what is coming and what will be changed: **over a year ahead!** I like the new, innovative and open Microsoft - big change!

This post will be about the changes I see in regards to SharePoint Search - and some topics around it - you could call it my Ignite Homework if you want to. I have some long train trips ahead - that helps a lot catching up.

## SharePoint 2016 and Search

The next version of SharePoint will be a release that supports and enables the transition to the cloud - others would say hybrid is the cool kid now.

So with that in mind, I filtered the [Ignite Video Page][3] and filtered on SharePoint, Search, Development, Delve, Office Graph - and from the 586 session (phew, what a number!) I downloaded ~25 sessions to watch them when my time allows it. And I am somewhat obsessed with level 400 sessions…&#8230;

And some of them here as link list, I will update them once I am trough (not chronologically). My comments and thoughts are below.

      1. A must see by Bill Bear, very informative what is coming and what we can expect of the new release. He mentions hybrid a lot.

      1. That was the most entertaining session so far with 4.5 smart guys ([Bill Baer][11], [Alexandre Cipriani][12], [Chris Givens][13], [Waldek Mastykarz][14], [Mikael Svenson][15]) crafting solutions around Office Graph - even tho I knew that Mikael Svenson would win the challenge <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" src="https://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/wlEmoticon-smile5.png" alt="Smile" />.

        ## Early Takeaway
        
        Over 25 hours of awesome stuff - that’s awesome! And it really helps me compensating that I couldn't meet a lot of friends at this years Ignite. The parts where search is covered is quite extensive, so much that I couldn't have covered them at the conference. One pain point that I miss from last years conference: The questions after the sessions are not in the recording - and I really learned a lot last year by listening to the questions/answers afterwards. Well, a reason to attend next year, right?
        
        I really like where Office Graph is heading - from Org View, Discovery, Relevancy, Context - the product is so versatile that I really want to see more of it. The potential of it goes through the roof! And with the Cloud Search Service Application and extensibility it can totally rock. Looking forward for future projects here!
        
        Last sentence: Search is everywhere!
        
        ## What are your favorites?
        
        I am always open to new stuff - maybe I missed an awesome session - if so, please leave a comment!
