As of writing this post (July 14, 2019) there are 149 [Azure Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview) available and 51 are in preview. In this post I try to come up with a decent set of 'common sense' policies that can prevent data leaks or other issues. Some of them are so essential, that I would always recommend to enable them - some of them are very specific, so it depends.

## Available Azure Policies

The following tables contains all the policies that are available for production environments. I removed all that started with [Deprecated] (24 as of now). I used a [simple powershell script](get-policy.ps1) that exports the available policies so I can use them in this post. [Scroll all the way down](#recommendation) if you want to see my recommendation.

| Name        | Description           |
|:------------- |:--------------|
| A maximum of 3 owners should be designated for your subscription | It is recommended to designate up to 3 subscription owners in order to reduce the potential for breach by a compromised owner. |
| Access through Internet facing endpoint should be restricted | Azure Security center has identified some of your Network Security Groups' inbound rules to be too permissive. Inbound rules should not allow access from 'Any' or 'Internet' ranges. This can potentially enable attackers to easily target your resources. |
| Adaptive Application Controls should be enabled on virtual machines | Possible Application Whitelist configuration will be monitored by Azure Security Center |
| Advanced data security settings for SQL managed instance should contain an email address to receive security alerts | Ensure that an email address is provided for the 'Send alerts to' field in the Advanced Data Security server settings. This email address receives alert notifications when anomalous activities are detected on SQL managed instances. |
| Advanced data security should be enabled on your managed instances | Audit SQL managed instances without Advanced Data Security |
| Advanced data security should be enabled on your SQL servers | Audit SQL servers without Advanced Data Security |
| Advanced Threat Protection types should be set to 'All' in SQL managed instance Advanced Data Security settings | It is recommended to enable all Advanced Threat Protection types on your SQL servers. Enabling all types protects against SQL injection, database vulnerabilities, and any other anomalous activities. |
| Advanced Threat Protection types should be set to 'All' in SQL server Advanced Data Security settings | It is recommended to enable all Advanced Threat Protection types on your SQL servers. Enabling all types protects against SQL injection, database vulnerabilities, and any other anomalous activities. |
| All authorization rules except RootManageSharedAccessKey should be removed from Event Hub namespace | Event Hub clients should not use a namespace level access policy that provides access to all queues and topics in a namespace. To align with the least privilege security model, you shoud create access policies at the entity level for queues and topics to provide access to only the specific entity |
| All authorization rules except RootManageSharedAccessKey should be removed from Service Bus namespace | Service Bus clients should not use a namespace level access policy that provides access to all queues and topics in a namespace. To align with the least privilege security model, you shoud create access policies at the entity level for queues and topics to provide access to only the specific entity |

## Recommendation

Allow resource creation if ‘environment’ tag value in allowed values

## Summary

"Common sense is not that common" - one of quotes my friend [Tom Janetscheck](https://blog.azureandbeyond.com/) uses (and stolen from Voltaire!): In this post I explained why I would always enable certain policies and what the impact is - if you have other 'Azure Policy'-must-haves, please let me know!

Hope it helps,
