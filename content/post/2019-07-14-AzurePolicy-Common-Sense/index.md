As of writing this post (August 8th, 2019) there are 159 [Azure Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview) available and 111 are in preview (and 27 deprecated). In this post I try to come up with a decent set of 'common sense' policies that can prevent data leaks or other issues, I focus primarily on security-related policies. Some of them are so essential, that I would always recommend to enable them - some of them are very specific, so let us use the old consultant wisdom: "it depends"!

This post assumes that you are aware of the Azure Policy capabilities - if not, please read the [excellent overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview) first. Azure Policy should be a critical component of ever Azure Governance implementation - combined with Azure Management Groups, Blueprints and Cost Management it is really a big enabler.

## Available Azure Policies

The following tables contains all the policies that are available for production environments - and removed all that started with [Deprecated], 27 as of now. I used a [simple powershell script](get-policy.ps1) that exports the available policies so I can use them in this post. [Scroll all the way down](#recommendation) if you want to see my recommendation or [the custom policies I would add](#custom-policies-i-would-add).
It took me a month to finish this post, 10 new policies moved from preview to production and 60 new policies are available for preview.

| Name        | Description           |
|:------------- |:--------------|
| A maximum of 3 owners should be designated for your subscription | It is recommended to designate up to 3 subscription owners in order to reduce the potential for breach by a compromised owner. |

## Recommendation

The following 12 out-of-the-box policies belong to my favorites - I selected them with a typical "large enterprise central IT hub & spoke" setup in mind and do not cover specific cases, more the general hardening and guidance if you delegate subscriptions to business departments: Imagine you would have to secure the spokes without having direct access to it and still want to provide the business units with the flexibility and power of Azure. If you are in doubt if the policy guides the users or blocks them, start with an [audit effect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/effects#audit) so you can assess the impact first and talk to the users that would be affected. Security and Governance is never a one-man-show and there are always scenarios that you could not come up with.
Cloud-native governance must give you control but still ensures the speed of the business - having a traditional 'get an approval first' process before someone can do something is not the way it should be, right?

### A maximum of 3 owners should be designated for your subscription & There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription

'Too many cooks spoil the broth' - if there are too many owners, who owns? 
Same applies to 'only one' owner. So it should be 2-3 owners, not more, not less.

### Access through Internet facing endpoint should be restricted

Permissive NSGs or lack of Azure firewalls are potential entry points - secure that boundary.

### Allow resource creation if ‘environment’ tag value in allowed values

Specifying if a resource is crucial or not can be super important. So having this policy in place enables transparency of what it dev, test or production. I would go a little further and combine the policy with [resource locks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-lock-resources). When a resource is flagged for production, there should be resource lock that prevents deletion - the policy should configured with an audit effect.

There are other 'Allow if tag value is set' policies - depending on your scenario, they are worth a look!

### Allowed locations

Typically there are agreed locations that can be used - prevent resource creation in other places. Ensure that the regions with [availability zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview#services-support-by-region) are included - and do not forget the [paired regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions) for disaster recovery.

### Audit virtual machines without disaster recovery configured

That is a great policy. At least for all production VMs there should be Azure Size Recovery configured so that you can recover to a secondary region (I like [the idea](https://adinermie.com/auditing-for-disaster-recovery-with-azure-policy/) to combine it with further tags to have the policy more specific).

### Audit VMs that do not use managed disks

It would discuss all usages of unmanged disks - if you create a new workload, I would use managed disks everywhere.

### Function App should only be accessible over HTTPS

What could be the reason to make a function available un-encrypted? Guide and ensure everyone to have them encrypted.

### MFA should be enabled on accounts with owner permissions on your subscription

With great power comes great responsibility - and these people have to be protected. ["81 percent of successful cyberattacks begin with a compromised username and password"](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Active-Directory-Identity/Announcing-the-public-preview-of-Azure-AD-support-for-FIDO2/ba-p/746362), if MFA is an option for you, enforce it.

### Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled

When I started to write this post, I thought this is a no-brainer. There is always [an exception](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/storage/files/storage-troubleshoot-linux-file-connection-problems.md) to the rule, right?

### Web Application should only be accessible over HTTPS

Again, always have HTTPS for traffic - see https://doesmysiteneedhttps.com/

### [Preview]: Audit Linux VMs that have accounts without passwords

No password, really!? It makes a login really easy but it should not.
This policy is in preview as of now, so no production-usage!

### [Preview]: Audit Windows VMs that contain certificates expiring within the specified number of days

Where has this been all my life? I have seen so many production outages because of expiring certificates. A central place to audit this is great.
This policy is in preview as of now, so no production-usage!

## Custom Policies I would add

You can create and adjust the policies to your needs, and that is really the strength of the platform. There are already a lot of examples available in the [Azure Policy repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/samples/Network/no-public-ip-except-for-one-subnet/azurepolicy.json), I typically start with them.

So in certain cases I would recommend the following: 

1. Regulate Azure Marketplace, see example in my post "[AZURE GOVERNANCE: GOVERN THE AZURE MARKETPLACE WITH AZURE POLICY](https://melcher.dev/2018/11/azure-governance-govern-the-azure-marketplace-with-azure-policy/)"
2. No public IP for VMs. See the "[Only Allow public IP in specific subnets](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/samples/Network/no-public-ip-except-for-one-subnet)" example and adjust it. This has huge impact to many services, start with AUDIT effect!

## Summary

"Common sense is not that common" - my friend [Tom Janetscheck](https://blog.azureandbeyond.com/) uses in his excellent Azure Governance and Security workshops (stolen from Voltaire!).
In this post I explained why I would always enable certain policies and what the impact is - if you have other 'Azure Policy'-must-haves or questions, please let me know!

Hope it helps,
