Okay, this is a session out of my usual scope. The title of the session caught me and as it seems it was totally worth it.

Here are my session takeaways.

Session by [Andy Malone][2] (<a href="http://twitter.com/andymalone" target="_blank">@andymalone</a>) – MVP Enterprise Security.

## Why would someone steal data from you?

Andy listed a lot of reasons and motivations why people steal data from companies. Potential threats are always the guys quitting a job (or the ones who quitted mentally already). Often espionage is not easy to detect, there are very advanced technical gimmicks (pen cam, tie cam, microphones).

I like this one:

Interesting question for the audience:

> Who is a network administrator?

Couple of hands went up.

> Who is responsible for security ?

Almost the same amount of hands are up – oooops, not good.

## Tools

Andy showed a bunch of tools how to gather information. It started with a simple websearch and then he expanded it to “one click” tools downloading and analyzing available documents. Running Windows 2000 – harvesting all email accounts in a company. Wow, amazing how easy it is. All tools are listed in his <a href="http://video.ch9.ms/sessions/teched/eu/2013/ATC-B314.pptx" target="_blank">slides</a>.

## My evaluation

Entertaining and it still makes you thinking! Great, great session, totally enjoyed it. Its one of the session you should watch the recording once its available <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Europe/2013/ATC-B314#fbid=brbMsfI4lBZ" target="_blank">here</a>.
