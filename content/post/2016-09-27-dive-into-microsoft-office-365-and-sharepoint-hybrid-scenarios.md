Session with Bill Bear and Rick Taylor about all things hybrid.

Here are my notes:

## Hybrid Scenarios

Bill started with hosting scenarios from traditional, private and public cloud options:

> If you are in doubt check if there is a bigger company in your area that moved to the cloud

### Business Needs

Different view to meet business needs is to look at the time to deliver:

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="WP_20160927_14_27_31_Rich" src="https://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/WP_20160927_14_27_31_Rich_thumb.jpg" alt="WP_20160927_14_27_31_Rich" width="244" height="139" border="0" />][3]

and your application needs: dynamic scale required? uptime sla?

### Why hybrid?

There are special scenarios where hybrid is a good idea e.g. limited bandwidth.

### More hybrid functionality is coming

Unified Managed Metadata (yeah!!!)
  
Unified Auditing

### Hybrid Workloads

  1. Search: Index onPrem data storages and unify them in the SharePoint Online Search Index.
  2. Business Connectivity Services: Complex to setup because of two-way authentication, only OData datasources
  3. OneDrive: redirect to the online service
  4. TeamSites: The site app shows tiles from both onPrem and SPO
  5. Social: basically Bill showed Yammer-embed here
  6. Auditing: Hybrid auditing unifies login, view of documents and more in a single place.

## Summary

Room was packed full, Bill and Rick did a very solid session with tons of infos – good stuff!
