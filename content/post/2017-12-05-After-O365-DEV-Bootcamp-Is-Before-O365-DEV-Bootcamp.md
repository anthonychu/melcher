Roughly 2 weeks after the last bootcamp its time to sum up - and share the slides!<!--more-->

## Office 365 Dev Bootcamp in Munich / Hamburg / Berlin - a Retrospective!

In September 2017 a [global initiative was launched by Jeff Teper](https://dev.office.com/blogs/global-office365-developer-bootcamp) to organize deep dive bootcamps for developers - with focus topics around Office 365, of course. I had the pleasure to organize three bootcamps in Munich, Hamburg and Berlin - and had great fun presenting and sharing hands-on experiences with ~50 attendees. Munich and Berlin were hold in English, Hamburg (only few people made it) was in German. 

> As of now, there have been **31 events around the globe**:  Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Africa, Span, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States!

The preparations of the lab was the most time consuming part - even tho we got some lab content for Microsoft Teams - but really understanding the matter and getting things to actually work took me quite some time - and of course I didnt stick to the lab and tried to make it my own (guess where things did not work...?!). 
### Did I mention that MS Teams is awesome? 
Developing for it was good fun! I enjoyed creating a check-in page that posts back to a channel, developing a custom tab that shows all checked-in attendees and the "almost" finished sandwich bot - good stuff!

Having a team-space with a chat that all the attendees could use during the event was nice! I could imagine that we repeat that (*once the onboarding process is less time consuming!*).

## Next year

No more bootcamps this year from my side - but I plan to be part of the events in the second half of next year. Looking forward to it, I had great fun and learned a lot!

See ya,
