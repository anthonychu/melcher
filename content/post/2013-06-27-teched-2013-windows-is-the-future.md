This keynote is, as the title indicates, all about Windows 8.1.

My takeaways and impressions after the jump.

## Windows 8.1 Enhancements

It seems like there are hundred of little enhancements in Windows 8.1. Here are some of my favorites!

  * Boot to Desktop – easy to set up in the start menu Properties
  * Charms bar -  aligned to the position where you triggered the bar
  * Win+x menu – has now shutdown, great
  * Start Menu – pressing windows triggers the start screen only on the current screen and its less intrusive
  * Start Menu – can be locked down so people in your organization can not change it.
  * Kiosk mode- lock down to single apps.
  * App alignment: there are multiple columns now in Windows 8.1, great to align them as you want.

## Devices

Okay, there are some new fancy form factors. I liked the variety of them:

## Web Things and other stuff

  * Web DASH – hopefully I got the right name for this: It’s a better support for video streaming over http
  * WebGL – integrated in the platform
  * 3D Printing – there is a new standard for 3D printing built into Windows 8.1. The print menu is the same as for printing 2D documents – smart move.
  * Outlook 2013 RT – available on every RT device
  * Workplace join & work folders – this is interesting, clients can join a domain by themselves, after that they have access to their work folders.

## Security

  * Touch based finger print scanners – No more swiping, you touch the finger print scanners.
  * Store – touch to give your consent to buy stuff in the windows store, no passwords.
  * First time setup – login, skydrive pro gets all your data, much more integrated approach. Same applies for apps, with on demand download if you need them earlier.

## Pictures

My iPhone apparently do not like the light settings, but here are some impressions.

## My evaluation

Actually, the keynote was pretty weak. They showed some minor features, nothing new with a “wow” effect. This is maybe because of the parallel BUILD, who knows.
