For the past 7.5 years I worked as Consultant at [Alegri](https://alegri.eu) in Munich - and I am immensely grateful for all the experience I gathered there with awesome colleagues and a very open and rewarding culture! From SharePoint to Office 365 to Azure I had very diverse and challenging projects and I learned a lot and had good fun - thanks a lot!

But for some time now, I was thinking of heading in another direction. Because one of my passions is learning new things and sharing knowledge with others, I accepted a job opportunity from Microsoft in Munich. As a Microsoft MVP, I already had a very intense relationship with Microsoft and I really like the "new" Microsoft with its open, innovative and very successful way of doing stuff - especially with my favorite cloud, Microsoft Azure!

## Hello Microsoft

So Monday, 1st October 2018, is my very first day at Microsoft in my new role as **Cloud Solution Architect** in the Customer Success Unit (CSU) - and I am super happy and excited about this new opportunity! With my broad focus and background I am looking forward to build awesome solutions on Azure - with strong Microsoft partners and many many customers, of course. As a long time partner myself, I know what it means to have a healthy relationship with Microsoft to drive the success of a project - and that's exactly what I want to do in my new role. I call it a triple win: Customer, Partner, Microsoft - if there is a good balance, everybody is happy and the project succeeds expectations in short time.

## Bye Bye MVP

I have a laughing and a crying eye here: Accepting the role at Microsoft means that I am no longer a Microsoft MVP - the award is only granted to externals and meant a lot to me: I really had lots of fun as MVP. Organizing events, speaking at user groups, connecting people - or walking among the best and motivated people around was a great honor!
Unfortunately, I couldn't go to the MVP summit last year - but at least I don't know now what I will miss :)
One thing won't change Tho: if my time allows it, I will still support the community as good as I can - I learned so much at all the events, got new friends and had fun - yupp, that **will be continued**.

## Job Interview at Microsoft

Surprisingly the process to apply at Microsoft was rather uncomplicated.
Apply for a job at [careers.microsoft.com](https://careers.microsoft.com), and the platform will guide you through all the required steps.
I was recommended for two jobs, so in total I had like 5 interviews.
Until I had my contract was like 2-3 weeks - and that during summer vacation time in Munich.

## Cloud Solution Architect

So what is my new job about? Let's look at the job description from the careers page:
> Overseeing Digital Transformation Success: The CSA plays a critical role in working with partners to
> provide deep Cloud Infrastructure technical support through solution build and first mile customer 
> engagements including Proof of Concepts, Architectural Design Sessions (ADS).
 
> The Role: The CSA is a Solutions Architect building relationship with partner technical and development 
> resources designing and architecting new Cloud Infrastructure solutions on Microsoft's Azure cloud 
> platform and technologies. CSAs deliver value via a portfolio of service delivery engagements optimized to 
> accelerate partner solution builds and first mile customer wins.
 
> A Solutions Architect: The CSA Is a technology expert who stands out because of their deep solutions 
> knowledge. They can go toe-to-toe with Microsoft's engineering teams and blackbelts often surfacing 
> product issues, feeding back data and insights that accelerate fixes and updates.

That sounds like a lot of fun to me!
