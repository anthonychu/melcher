## Let's start: OneDrive

{{< fancybox "/wp-content/uploads" "WP_20160926_14_26_54_Rich-e1474914811741.jpg" "" "single_image" >}}

1. New sync options
2. Access all files
3. Mobile app improvements
4. Better file preview
5. Deeper Office integration
6. OneDrive file activity

The last point is Jeff's favorite - who changed what file recently is really helpful!

### Demo: File preview

RAW files, Streaming Videos, Adobe files incl. Photoshop files and Illustrator files - no more downloading required. Rich preview for email files (eml, msg) - in total 20 more files will be prerendered soon.

### Demo: Mobile Improvements

The iOS OneDrive app has been shown, major improvements to file handling and navigation - looks neat!

{{< fancybox "/wp-content/uploads" "WP_20160926_14_26_52_Rich-e1474935031289.jpg" "" "single_image" >}}

### Demo: Office Integration

There is a new integration option in the office backstage "open" menu. "Shared with me" shows all files that has been recently shared with you - awesome! That a great improvement for me, too. Additinally in the top right you can see the

### Demo: One more thing - Placeholders will be back!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I almost dropped my notebook, Placeholders for OneDrive are coming back. They added a neat little icon to visualize that the file is not synced yet (the little cloud) and once you click on it you it downloads and opens. This will make lots of users VERY HAPPY and 72.000 votes will be returned on user voice. This makes me happy, too!{{< fancybox "/wp-content/uploads" "2016-09-26-14_46_46-Give-us-back-our-storage-–-Feature-Suggestions-for-Microsoft-OneDrive.png" "" "single_image" >}}

{{< fancybox "/wp-content/uploads" "WP_20160926_14_49_47_Rich-1-e1474935742680.jpg" "" "single_image" >}}

Better Office Graph integration to feed the SharePoint landing page (the SharePoint tile).

### Improvements to Teamsites

Teamsites get a big refresh. Lading page now contains a news section, activity and looks much cleaner now. Wow, that was really necessary for such an core component. The same layout will be available in the mobile apps. Cool stuff!

{{< fancybox "/wp-content/uploads" "WP_20160926_14_49_51_Rich-1-e1474935876413.jpg" "" "single_image" >}}

### Modern SharePoint Pages

> render better on mobile phones, faster, beautiful

The new page experience is much more convenient compared to the old one. Adding webparts looks much easier, lots of content creators will love those improvements. Adding pictures is now simpler, too. Apparently i was so flashed about the OneDrive announcement that I forget to take a picture.

{{< fancybox "/wp-content/uploads" "WP_20160926_15_07_28_Rich-e1474937460383.jpg" "" "single_image" >}}

### Files

The new document library experience is out a while now, there are new improvements coming for this. Dropping a link to the library was one of the first examples.

Drag and drop to change status based on a grouping:

{{< fancybox "/wp-content/uploads" "WP_20160926_14_56_11_Rich-1.jpg" "" "single_image" >}}

&nbsp;

New Document experience will also support 3rd party extensions - we briefly saw a DocuSign integration.

### Lists

Richer context information directly from the list view called "people card". This shows more details about a person who modified the file. Jump to profiles.

{{< fancybox "/wp-content/uploads" "WP_20160926_15_00_15_Rich-e1474936560721.jpg" "" "single_image" >}}

### User Profiles

The new user profiles will be overhauled, too. You can see a mini schedule on the profile page, what groups the user is in and more. The update experience of your profile page is more streamlined - awesome!

### Microsoft Flow

Very brief showcase how to integrate Power Apps and Flow into SharePoint lists - super fast demo, more this week I think.

{{< fancybox "/wp-content/uploads" "WP_20160926_15_02_06_Rich-e1474937321729.jpg" "" "single_image" >}}

There was a joke with Jeff's shoes - somehow I could not follow.

### Planner, Yammer and integrations

Integration in Outlook, integration into Yammer - last but not least a new teamsite will have a new group, too.

### Teamsites #2

Fast teamsite creation is coming to O365 - Dan created a new teamsite in less than 5 seconds. Neat!

{{< fancybox "/wp-content/uploads" "WP_20160926_15_06_07_Rich-e1474937508828.jpg" "" "single_image" >}}

## Open and connected platform

Easier start with open standards. SharePoint and lists will come to Office graph soon.

{{< fancybox "/wp-content/uploads" "2016-09-26-15_14_58-MyIgnite-Learn-how-SharePoint-is-reinventing-content-collaboration_-vision-and.png" "" "single_image" >}}

### SharePoint Framework SPFx

Switch to client-side development, lightweb and super fast-  with mobile phone support. Teamsite and library extensions are coming.

{{< fancybox "/wp-content/uploads" "WP_20160926_15_08_33_Rich-e1474937886296.jpg" "" "single_image" >}}

## Security

New options to limit access, printing, downloading and synching of documents if the computer accessing it is not a domain joined computer. Conditional access even by network location (IP range). The moment they leave the network (e.g. work)

{{< fancybox "/wp-content/uploads" "WP_20160926_15_11_18_Rich-e1474937947467.jpg" "" "single_image" >}}

### Demo: Conditional access

The demo was simple. The presenter just switch to a different network - bam! No more access to the SharePoint library. Good stuff, many of my clients want that.

{{< fancybox "/wp-content/uploads" "WP_20160926_15_19_58_Rich-e1474938087979.jpg" "" "single_image" >}}

### Custom teamsite creation tags / site classification

When you create teamsites you can add tags to it and then add rules to it. In this case the confidentiality.

### User Activities

In the new reports you can see activity and aggregated infos per user.

{{< fancybox "/wp-content/uploads" "WP_20160926_15_23_06_Rich-e1474938257391.jpg" "" "single_image" >}}

### Audit Log

Unified logging for both on-prem and online. Neat!

### Centralized sign-out

Its now possible to log out users via the admin centers - on all devices.
