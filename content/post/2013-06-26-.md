From the session description:

> Successful SharePoint deployments have one thing in common: great search!

So, true – here are my session notes.

<!--more-->

Session by Jan Inge Bergseth (MSFT, Search Center of Excellence). Slides + Video of the NA TechEd <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/SES-B310#fbid=WGzBjalI8qs" target="_blank">here</a>, but with a different speaker. 

## Architecture

I know a quite a lot about this topic, it was a pretty short overview about the architectural changes. The slides are based on the SPC slides (SPC202) – and that’s a good thing. 

## Demo

## 

Jan showed how easy it is to add Metadata and visualize them as a pie chart refiner in the search results page.

## Analytics Service

I should invest more time with this beauty –&#160; there is some hidden potential when you ask for “Suggested sites to follow” or “Are you looking for these again?”.

## Migration Scenarios

Okay, there is new information here. I had in mind that there is now migration story from FAST Search Server to SharePoint 2013 – but it seems there is one:

Maybe its supported, but the custom PowerShell line could be a “It depends!”. Jan said “undocumented”. 

## Backup and Restore

Everything but the index is in the database. 

## My questions after the session:

> Is there a rule of thumb for index size? 

Not an official one.

> Will there be Search Performance Evaluation with the same level of detail as there was for FST Search Server For SharePoint 2010?

Some started it – but its either not finished or not yet published. Too bad, I read the one for FAST several times. 

> Is there an OOTB solution to this <a href="http://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/71116/aam-with-searchcentre-on-its-own-web-app" target="_blank">question</a>? 

Not ad-hoc. Follow up mail with questions is on the way.

## My evaluation

Search – could talk and listen to this topic forever! The session is great by design. Okay, back to reality: Detailed session but I wish there would be a deeper session (Level 400, anyone?) for this. I learned the most after the sessions because the questions of the attendees covered the edge cases and tough situations. Still, enjoyed the session!
