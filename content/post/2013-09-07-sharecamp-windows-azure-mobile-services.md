Thorsten Hans ([@ThorstenHans][1]) showed a lot of examples how to send notifications via Windows Azure Mobile Services.

The story was “Build a contact form” with push notifications

  1. As a Windows 8 App
  2. As a SharePoint App

## Key takeaway

Easy, fast – good stuff. Wondering if the push based messages are based on <a href="http://signalr.net/" target="_blank">SignalR</a>.

The session was good fun, thanks Thorsten!
