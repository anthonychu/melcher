On June, 6th 2016 we have met at [Alegri][1] in Munich to have our very own [Enterprise Productivity & Search][2] meetup. This time [David Hollembaek][3] talked about Usage Analytics and how to easily gain insights by using Azure Application Insights.

We had ~10 attendees, great questions and lots of fun.

## Usage Analytics

Dave told us how easily it is to setup App Insights and add it to a page to track events. We had a short discussion "what to track" and whether there is a too much  (my opinion: grab as much as you can and filter later). He has two blog posts about this matter ("[Make better decisions with Usage Analytics in O365 and SharePoint][4]", "[Make Better Decisions with Usage Analytics Part 2][5]") - but best of all, here shared [his slides here][6]. Identify use cases, start measuring, analyze the results, optimize - and repeat! You need some reasons to prioritize features?
