Ignite 2016 session about apps, mobile experiences and intelligent portals by <a href="http://twitter.com/andyhaon" target="_blank">Andy Haon (@andyhaon)</a> and [Nate Clinton (@nate_clinton)][1].

Here are my notes:

## SharePoint Home

I was a little late to the session, so only a screenshot from the slides:

## Mobile Apps

Approach: look at the key workloads in regards to SharePoint and bring them to the mobile apps on all platforms.

Things they learned: Sign-in issues (a lot), analysis of top requests and implementing them

Android: feature parity with iOS but with respect to the material design. PowerApps integration comes first to Android

Windows 10 mobile: feature parity with iOS but with windows design. You have to be an Insider to get the app here: <https://aka.ms/spappwindows>

## Team News

Quickly author news with status updates or mention a document. News are available on mobile phones, too. Its planned to add mobile news authoring so you can craft news while on the go.

## Whats coming!

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="https://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/image_thumb-5.png" alt="image" width="244" height="137" border="0" />][5]

Intranet in your pocket, the changes that are coming are promising for that:

Notifications, News and list improvements will drive the adoption.

## Summary

To be honest, I expected this session to discuss about SharePoint Apps – no, I mean Addins! – and not about the mobile apps. But on the plus side, it was really good session that showed me whats possible in the apps – I am more a browser guy, but I will give it a try!

Good stuff.
