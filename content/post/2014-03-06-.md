> In this session we will showcase how Azure IaaS and SharePoint 2013 WCM provide greater flexibility and scale for high traffic sites. We will also provide best practices for scale out options, provide a performance comparison with a similar physical hardware. After this session you will be able to identify the number and types of machines you will require for your specific SharePoint Publishing and Web Content Management scenarios hosted in Azure.

My session notes for “Azure IaaS and SharePoint 2013 WCM - better together!” by Berry Waldbaum and Frank Marasco at SharePoint Conference 2014 in Las Vegas.

## 

## Scale in the past and now

Previously it was costly to create and test a large SharePoint farm – for an Internet-facing SharePoint site Azure is a good match.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="IMG_1958" alt="IMG_1958" src="http://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1958_thumb.jpg" width="348" height="185" border="0" />][2]{.thickbox}

> Q: Why you need a search guy for Internet-facing site?
  
> A: Because a lot of components are based on search – publishing, search webparts!

> Performance: 1 VM = 20 Page Views / second – that is a lot!

## On-Prem vs. Azure

Frank showed an on-prem environment that was used for Project Oslo – and a comparable, oversized Azure VM setup. The Azure SQL database had like 5 TB storage, everything separated.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="IMG_1961" alt="IMG_1961" src="http://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1961_thumb.jpg" width="348" height="185" border="0" />][4]{.thickbox}

Then 100 GB test data was uploaded – and – the downsizing started to make it more realistic and affordable.

### Test setup

Visual Studio Test 2 agents, with 80 users, 0 think time – hitting 4 pages with multiple CBS Web Parts.

### Results

Azure won. CPU was higher, RPS was higher, Response time was lower with 640ms compared to 750ms.

### Further adjustments

Adjusting the search topology – trimming everything down to 2 Servers + SQL server – 3 tier setup.

> Crawl was paused during tests – this can affect the performance.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="IMG_1968" alt="IMG_1968" src="http://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1968_thumb.jpg" width="348" height="185" border="0" />][6]{.thickbox}

Master Merge every 6 hours that affects performance tremendously. Maybe there will be an update later to balance this.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="IMG_1971" alt="IMG_1971" src="http://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1971_thumb.jpg" width="348" height="185" border="0" />][7]{.thickbox}

Frank & Berry showed 4 scenarios from 80 simultaneous users to simultaneous 10 users – and how that affected the page response time.

[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="IMG_1975" alt="IMG_1975" src="http://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1975_thumb.jpg" width="348" height="185" border="0" />][8]{.thickbox}[<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="IMG_1973" alt="IMG_1973" src="http://melcher.it/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1973_thumb.jpg" width="348" height="185" border="0" />][9]{.thickbox}

The key message is that you need to monitor the performance pattern and adjust accordingly – you can effectively cut costs. Try that with on-prem infrastructure.

## Summary

That was another good one. Frank and Berry on the stage, that is pure experience. Frank’s story how he created and tested the Azure VMs was good fun. Creating this tests to present them here must have taken quite some time – good stuff.
