300 attendees on a Saturday - all “SharePoint-crazy” - that's what I said last year and it's very true for this year, too!

## SPSBE

Fun from the start at 9:00am until the official end of [SPSBE (SharePoint Saturday Belgium)][1] at around 19:30!
  
I apparently had to optimize my session on this Saturday (_50 minutes slots instead of 60!_), tests my demos and pimp my slides - so I could only attend one full session (_Deep Dive building solutions on the SharePoint Framework_ by Waldek Mastykarz [@waldekm][2]), but there was enough time for me to talk to friends, community members, [BIWUG][3] board members and other speakers - good times, good fun.

Great venue, great speaker lineup - everything was great! I am leaving Belgium the second time - impressed!

Impressive schedule packed with insights and speakers from around the world.

## My Session: Hybrid Search - Everything YOU need to know!

I had a really good time presenting my content about hybrid Search - and the demo gods were with me, all planned demoes worked like a charm - I uploaded my slides, but the cool stuff is in the demos and I can't make them available: [SPSBE 2016: HybridSearch][4]

At the very beginning of my session we had some sound issues, another microphone was connected to my room - but well, we all had some fun!

During and after the talk there were like 5 to 10 questions (Data Privacy and regulation, Encryption of the content, Bandwidth requirements, implementation strategy)- but only the first 4 got a free beer from me 🙂

> Good questions gives you good beer!
