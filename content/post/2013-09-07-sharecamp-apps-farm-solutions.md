Controversial discussion about the new App Model and very nice experience sharing.

Here are my key questions and thoughts about the session by [Christian Groß][1].

## Deployment? What are the limits and advantages

  1. Security – when you trust you can choose what rights the app has.
  2. Technology independent (Coose what every technology you want, e.g. .NET version)
  3. Life cycle – when you update you app you have to update the app on each subscriber web. Ouch. Nobody knew whether you could automate that.

## When is the right time to switch to the App Model?

That was a nice discussion with no final decision – but 10 out of 11 attendees agreed that the app model is too promising to ignore.

## Key takeaway

Not a classical session - but we had fun during the discussion.
