Today I had my very first (recorded) interview. [Thomas Maier](https://twitter.com/spschwabe) from [Office365akademie.de](https://Office365akademie.de) asked me some very interesting questions how to migrate from SharePoint 2007-2016 to SharePoint Online/Office 365. We talked almost 30 minutes about all challenges (there are more, of course!) you might encounter. Good fun! <!--more-->

- What's your oppionion about the new migration tool for SharePoint? 
- What other tools are available from Microsoft? 
- When do you think that 3rd party tools are required?
