Given the COVID-19 situation and the flexibility I have working for Microsoft, I decided to invest a little bit in my home office and upgrade a few things here and there - I spent more than 8 hours in my home office every day, so every  penny spent is a good investment, right? <!--more-->

## Desk
As you can see in the picture above, I built a pretty big desk. If I sit to much I get terrible back pain, thats why bought a height adjustable frame ([Flexispot E5](https://amzn.to/2XF7P1W)) and went to the hardware store and bought a 2 meter panel. Super happy about the outcome and it really reduced my back pain.

## PC Upgrade
99% of the times I work from my private PC with two screens.  I have not upgraded my PC for 5 years, so I decided to buy a few new components to speed things up - looking at you Teams - and do some local development with VSCode & Docker. Right-sizing the upgrade was not easy, but I think I found a good mix:

  * [Rayzen AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8x 3.60GHz So.AM4 BOX](https://amzn.to/2TS42x6)
  * [RAM 16GB (2x 8192MB) G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4-3600 DIMM CL16-19-19-39 Dual Kit](https://amzn.to/2ZNc91S)
  * [Motherboard MSI MPG X570 GAMING EDGE WIFI AMD X570 So.AM4 Dual Channel DDR4 ATX Retail](https://amzn.to/3dhBVz4)

The case, graphics card and power supply, disks and whatnot are already in place - keeping them for now. But upgrading from 4 cores to 16 cores is really really making a difference here. First time that I bought an AMD CPU instead of an Intel CPU.

The displays you can see above are [Asus VG248QE 24-inch 3D LED Monitor - Black (1920x1080, 80000000:1, 144 Hz, 1ms, DVI Display Port, HDMI)](https://amzn.to/3cho3Um) - I tried one big screen and had to return it; two or three screens are my preference.

## Input
The last purchase I made was a keyboard [Logitech K740 wired keyboard](https://amzn.to/2BgJCaP) that was recommended to me, now my muscle memory needs to be reset - typing is really hard now. But the keyboard is quiet enough so that I can type during meetings without being on mute. The keyboard is accompanied by a [Logitech G500 mouse](https://amzn.to/2May5fj) - now superseded by [Logitech G502](https://amzn.to/2XdKOEb). Everything wired, I don't want to charge mission-critical stuff.

## Audio / Video
A really great investment is the [Logitech Brio](https://amzn.to/2ZOsbZi) - the Windows Hello support is really great. I boot the computer, smile, and I am logged in.
Having a good video quality in meetings is more important nowadays, too. 
If my wife and kid are around, then I typically switch to my headset [ASTRO Gaming A50](https://amzn.to/2XGQYfl). It is super comfortable and the audio quality is just perfect. 8 hour meetings are doable with it - both the headset and the Brio work great with Teams/Webex/Hangout.

## Environmental things
I am a big fan of Hue lights - the automation possibilities are really great. Therefore I bought a couple of them and added some magic to it. When someone rings the doorbell, only the lights blink - no noise that could bother me. Quite helpful when the kid sleeps, too. 
For some ambient lights, I bought two [Hue Ambiance Light bars](https://amzn.to/2XLGX1s) and turned them to the wall - with the hue sync app it is a really great experience especially during the night or when gaming!
Additionally I bought an [EVE Room 2](https://amzn.to/3gAE37m) to monitor the air quality (if it decreases, one Hue light turns red) and the temperature. The runtime of this gadget with the e-ink display is like a month.

For the past couple of years I could perfectly live without a printer - but - staying at home changed this. Therefore I bought a color laser printer ([HP Color Laser 179fwg](https://amzn.to/2ZM0Dnv)). At first I thought the Wifi-integration is not needed, but I printed several times from my iPhone and that is really cool! 

## Closing
Lots of nice things here - some of them are gadgets and not really required - but it has to be fun, right?
