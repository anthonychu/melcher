WOPI Signature verification attempt failed with public key <Hash of public key> [0 ms]

WOPI Proof: All WOPI Signature verification attempts failed

From <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj219460.aspx" target="_blank">Technet</a>: 

> The **Update-SPWOPIProofKey** cmdlet updates the public key that is used to connect to the WOPI application (which could be a server that runs Office Web Apps Server) on the current SharePoint farm where this cmdlet is run. You may want to use this cmdlet if the keys become **unsynchronized** between the SharePoint farm and the WOPI application. If the keys are unsynchronized, documents may not open in the browser and messages such as “Invalid Proof Signature for file…” or “Invalid Proof Signature for folder&#8230;” are found in the Unified Logging System (ULS) logs.
