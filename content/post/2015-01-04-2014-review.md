Traditions are traditions - at least when you repeat at least once, right? So last year I started to review&nbsp;my year with SharePoint - lets do it again.

## Conferences & Social

2013 started great - _**after several attempts**_ I convinced my company to send me&nbsp;to the [very last][1]&nbsp;SharePoint Conference in Las Vegas - and it was epic. Not only that I covered 30 SharePoint sessions, I met friends and new friends - I knew some of them via Twitter for a long time, but meeting in person is a totally different story, of course! If you wanna relieve my experience including my summary you can read [my posts here][2].

On the speaking side, I submitted 10-15 sessions this year, some where accepted, some rejected. I was accepted in Zürich, Switzerland at [Collaboration Days][3]&nbsp;(international speaker, yay!) and in Duesseldorf at [ShareConf][4], Germany - I had good fun and received good feedback. The most challenging speaking engagement was **SP24** - even tho my session was pre-recorded. My inner devil forced me to record [my session][5] (50 Minutes) multiple times - in the end I did not need a script, even for the jokes 😉

Additionally I visted the [User Group in Munich][6] several times - of course I had a search talk there. Will continue that in 2015, for sure.

With Dave Hollembaek, we started an **"informal gathering" / Stammtisch about Enterprise Search** (we are not limited to SharePoint, but focused) in Munich - [if you wanna join][7], please feel free!

**More conferences are on my&nbsp;roadmap for 2015!&nbsp;**

## Blogs & Comments

I spent some time with&nbsp;my little blog this year - new theme with mobile support and **31 blog posts** - on the statistics side (I love analytics!) I had&nbsp;**78,783 views** on my blog (82% more than 2013) and 133 comments (29% more than 2013) with 103 blog posts in total.

## Search Projects

When I look at my projects of 2014 most of them were somehow SharePoint Search-related. **My clients are obviously the best** - so they gave my some pretty nice challenges, mostly integration of SAP or third party systems - or indexing huge volumns (90,000,000 items in 2 weeks). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thanks for the continued trust!</strong></span>

## **SharePoint Certifications**

I only managed to pass&nbsp;two Certifications last year - but a new years resolution is to finish both my MCSE (only 70-332 missing!!!) and MCSD for SharePoint 2013. I tried to register for a training, but I was greated with:

> After December 31st, 2014 if you wish to take a Microsoft certification exam, please visit the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning" target="_blank">Microsoft Learning web site</a> for further information.

So I tried to scheduled an online proctored exam - but Germany is not on the list&#8230; so I scheduled a on-site exam beginning of January. Yay!

## Predictions {.}

  * 2015 will be the year of search! Again.

<p class="">
  For 2014 I predicted that the Service Pack 1 for SharePoint 2013 will bring some major search enhancements - some under the hood features were added, but I am still waiting for the long "announced" push API. I hope to see Delve for on-prem installations, too - but I think that will stay a wish. On the other side, that will hopefully push some to the cloud - or hybrid at least.
</p>

  * Hosting on Azure for Dev/Test will **even more** accelerate – even in Germany.

I said the same almost last year. But I saw some changes, some new clients moved directly to Office 365 - some at least looked at it. Cloud is still not very popular in Germany, in 2015 I hopefully see some more traction.

## Happy New Year!

<p class="">
  I wish you all a healthy and wealthy Happy New Year. Hope to see you soon!
