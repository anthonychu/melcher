## Context Apps

They said is several times now – context is the new thing.

### New Controls for Apps

[Microsoft released a new experimental][4] package over nuget that adds html controls to apps – they showed a listview and a people picker. Good stuff.

### Apps and Documents

Register a app for a file extension –.so you click on a file and it opens the specified application.

Poll Everywhere App – get live feedback via sms and represent it in a PowerPoint graph. They said they needed 3 weeks to publish the app to the market.

## Robust Office 365 APIs

More public API to access data sitting in SharePoint, OneDrive, Exchange and more – all based on oData – cool. New possibilities for Apps – and integration options.
