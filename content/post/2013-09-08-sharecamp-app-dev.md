Thorsten Hans ([@ThorstenHans][1]) and Christian Glessner ([@cglessner][2]) showed us how to develop SharePoint Apps (SharePoint hosted, Provider hosted).

## Live coding

Thorsten recommended to use the REST calls instead the JS client object model – they are faster and “more” future-proof.

Their experience was that autohosted is a little odd, the price conditions are not very clear. So there is provider hosted (Azure) or SharePoint hosted remaining.

## Key takeaway

I really like their sessions – zero slides sessions – good content.
